	the Myrtille.PDF virtual printer now opens the browser print dialog, removing the need to install a PDF viewer on the end user machine and providing direct access to local (or network) printers (not working with the built-in Firefox PDF.js, option to open/download the pdf instead)
	added swipe up/down gesture management for touchscreen devices (useful to scroll the display in applications that need it; can be disabled into the toolbar) * experimental feature! * not working on IE/Edge (see below)
	emulating mouse events for IE/Edge on touchscreen devices (touchscreen is disabled by default into IE/Edge and use pointer events instead of touch when enabled into about:flags)
	for easier auto-connect / start program from url management, you can generate a password hash from url (thanks jol64). syntax: https://server/myrtille/GetHash.aspx?password=password

2018-07-31 Version 2.0.0 (stable)
	Resynced FreeRDP (FQDN hotfix, introduced into myrtille 1.7.0, is still active... wfreerdp need some love :/)

	some refactoring

﻿2018-06-09 Version 1.9.1 (stable)

	added a client ip tracking option to prevent unauthorized accesses. configurable into web.config (thanks bigpjo)
	cookieless sessions are now disabled by default. This lowers the risk of session stealing (by simply copying the url) but also removes the ability to have multiple connections/tabs. can still be enabled into web.config, but use at your own risk! (thanks bigpjo)
	strengthened security to prevent session fixation attack or spoofing if cookieless sessions are enabled
	the remote session can now be shared with a new toolbar button that generates a one time usage url. can be disabled into web.config. (thanks bigpjo)

	fixed issue with enterprise host create session including invalid /popup/ path in sessionURL. (thanks bigpjo)
	the remote session is now disconnected after the browser window/tab is closed, or connection is lost, to prevent it from being left open server side. configurable into web.config (thanks bigpjo)
	the database connection string (into bin/Myrtille.Services.exe.config) can now be configured to specify the SQLCE file location or use a standard SQL server (useful for a centralized database, with myrtille clustered). (thanks bigpjo)

	ignore certificate warning (when using NLA); may happen, for example, with a self-signed certificate (not trusted) or if the server joined a domain after the certificate was issued (name mismatch). more details here: http://www.vkernel.ro/blog/configuring-certificates-in-2012r2-remote-desktop-services-rds (required with the latest FreeRDP build)
	connection settings (including user credentials) are no longer passed to FreeRDP through command line; using pipe communication instead (thanks Paul)

	custom mouse cursors are now supported with IE (thanks Thijs)
	added a "Right-Click" button (into the toolbar) to simulate a right-click action on devices which don't have a mouse (or a right button) (thanks Scott)
	performance tweak: now using PNG encoding by default (instead of mixed PNG/JPEG); drawback is it uses more bandwidth with graphic applications (use AUTO encoding in this case; config.js)
	performance tweak: disabled mouse move sampling; drawback is it may lower the responsiveness with graphical applications (enable the sampling in this case; 10% for example; config.js)
	performance tweak: disabled blob support (using base64 instead); blob is a newer javascript construct but is cached on disk whereas base64 data is cached in memory (faster); config.js

	increased max file upload/download size up to 1GB (tweakable into Myrtille.Web and Myrtille.Services configs, if needed)
