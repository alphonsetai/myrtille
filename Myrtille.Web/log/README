Here goes all myrtille log files (gateway, services, RDP, SSH, etc.).

CAUTION! logging requires the ASP.NET IIS worker process to have write permission to the "log" folder.
Among other options, you may grant the myrtille application pool ("IIS AppPool\MyrtilleAppPool") write permission to it (normally automatically set by the myrtille installer).
